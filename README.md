# CPE 400 Final Project - Self Healing Graph

## Introduction
This program is an implementation of a self-healing graph algorithm. 
It is worth noting I wrote this algorithm without researching the topic other 
than understanding what problem I needed to solve. I implemented this algorithm blind.
After finishing the algorithm I started to research other self-healing algorithms and found 
that what I had implemented, very closely resembles the DASH algorithm [outlined here](http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=cs_etds)


## Disclaimer
The structure and implementation of the NetworkGraph, Node, WeightedEdge classes was heavily influenced 
by the code in this post on codereview.stackoverflow.com originally written by Vardominator with edits
provided by t3chb0t and myself.
